# Reddit-Clone

Initially, wanted to mimic Reddit's behaviour without the architecture part to learn how things work and the slowly move on to the whole architecture set-up.

**Successfully Done:**  
- [x] Session Management  
- [x] Subreddit Creation  
- [x] Post to a specific Subreddit  
- [x] Main page for all the post from the subscribed Subreddits pertaining to the logged in User  
</br>

**Remaining:**  
- [ ] Comment thread
- [ ] Caching
- [ ] File Uploading
- [ ] Link Preview
- [ ] NSFW blur
- [ ] User follwoing another user
- [ ] Thinking of removing the comment table and replacing it with NoSql Database
- [ ] Frontend Part (Kept at bare minimum for now because cannot care less)

**Environment:**
* Windows OS
* Visual Studio 2015
