# Reddit-Clone

Initially, wanted to mimic Reddit's behaviour without the architecture part to learn how things work and the slowly move on to the whole architecture set-up.

**Successfully Done:**  
* Session Management  
* Subreddit Creation  
* Post to a specific Subreddit  
* Main page for all the post from the subscribed Subreddits pertaining to the logged in User  
</br>

**Remaining:**  
* Comment thread
* Thinking of removing the comment table and replacing it with NoSql Database
* Caching
* File Uploading
* Link Preview
* NSFW blur
* User follwoing another user
* Frontend Part (Kept at bare minimum for now because cannot care less)

**Environment:**
* Windows OS
* Visual Studio 2015
